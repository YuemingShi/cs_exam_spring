1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Smartphone that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.
    
     public class Smartphone extends Technology{
      int number;
      public Smartphone(String name, int number){
      super(name);
      this.number=number;
      }
b)  Explain what INHERITANCE is.

inheritance is when the super class has fields and methods, the sub class would inherite those.

c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number".  

public void speak(){
System.out.println("I am "+this.name+" and my number is "+this.number);
}

d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?
Polymorphism
